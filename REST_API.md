Want to make your Java REST API faster and handle more users?
 Two key things to focus on:
Latency = Time taken to process a request (lower is better).
Throughput = Number of requests handled per second (higher is better).
Letâ€™s explore simple ways to improve both! 
By making a few smart optimizations, your API can handle more users and respond faster.

Reduce API Response Time (Lower Latency)
ðŸ”¹ Optimize Database Queries: Use indexes and connection pooling to speed up queries.
ðŸ”¹ Cache Frequent Responses: Store data in Redis, Ehcache, or Caffeine to avoid repeated database calls.
ðŸ”¹ Compress API Responses: Enable GZIP compression to send smaller payloads.
ðŸ”¹ Use Asynchronous Processing: Execute tasks in the background using Completable Future.
 Increase API Throughput (Handle More Requests)
ðŸ”¹ Increase Thread Pool Size: Modify Tomcat max-threads to handle more concurrent requests.
ðŸ”¹ Load Balancing & Scaling: Distribute traffic across multiple servers with NGINX, Kubernetes, or AWS ALB.
ðŸ”¹ Use Circuit Breakers: Prevent failures from external services using Resilience4j.
 Monitor and Test API Performance
ðŸ”¹ Enable Spring Boot Actuator: Track API performance in real-time.
ðŸ”¹ Run Load Tests (JMeter, Gatling): Measure requests per second (RPS) and response times (P95, P99).
