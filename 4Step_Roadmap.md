If anybody is saying System Design is overrated in software engineering ask them to give few interviews be it for SDE/SDE2/SDE3 role.

They quickly realize that mastery of DSA alone won’t land the job at top PBCs.

Actually 80% of system design interview questions come from just 20% of topics? My guide, it'll help you focus on what really matters.
