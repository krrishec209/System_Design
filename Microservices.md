SpringBoot interview question and answer 
------------------------------------------------------
How do you handle inter-service communication in a microservice architecture in Springboot? 

There are 3 ways we can approach 

1️⃣ If it is simple microservice means we can use REST API's for communication. If one microservice send HTTP request other microservice receive response. It is synchronous communication.

2️⃣ In more complex applications, instead of manually creating HTTP requests, we can use Spring Cloud OpenFeign. It provides a declarative way to define REST clients, making the code cleaner and easier to manage. 

3️⃣ For asynchronous communication between 2 microservices we can use Apache Kafka. Here one microservice acts as a producer, sending messages to a Kafka topic. Another microservice acts as a consumer, processing the messages at its own pace.

20. CQRS and Event Sourcing: When and why to use them.
Learn it, build confidence, and become a technically sound Java developer.


***************

Designing microservices isn’t just about breaking a monolith — it’s about building a system that scales, survives, and evolves.

Here are some essential microservices design patterns I’ve explored (and used!):
 1. API Gateway Pattern
Central entry point for requests. Helps with routing, authentication, and throttling.
 2. Database per Service
Each service manages its own data. Promotes loose coupling but requires eventual consistency handling.
 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Prevents cascading failures. Think Netflix’s Hystrix or Resilience4j.
 4. Saga Pattern
Manages distributed transactions using a sequence of local transactions and compensating actions.
 5. Service Discovery
Dynamic service registration and discovery using tools like Eureka or Consul.
 6. Sidecar Pattern
Useful for adding common features like logging, monitoring, or config updates to each service via containers.

These patterns are crucial for building resilient, maintainable, and scalable architectures — especially when you’re working in Java with Spring Boot, Kafka, and Docker.

I’d love to hear from other devs:
