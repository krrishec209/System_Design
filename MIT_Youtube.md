5 Youtube playlists on Design and Algorithms that can help you become a better Software Engineer. ðŸ§¡ ðŸ’¯ 

I still havenâ€™t completed watching all of them, but can definitely say that they hold a plethora of good content. ðŸ”¥ 

â˜€ MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems playlist: This playlist touches upon multiple concepts of Distributed Systems like Zookeeper, RAFT, Replication, Consistency, Spanner, Fault Tolerance and much more in depth. âš¡ 

â˜€ MIT 6.046J Design and Analysis of Algorithms: The playlist holds 34 episodes of in-depth discussion on topics like Divide and Conquer, B-Trees, Basic DP and Advanced Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms, Minimum Spanning Tree and much more. This could really be helpful from a DSA and Competitive Programming perspective. ðŸ”¥ 

â˜€ CS 436 Distributed Computer Systems: A 24 episode series on Distributed Computer Systems taught in University of Waterloo. ðŸš€ 

â˜€ Software Architecture - InfoQ: The playlist holds 185 episodes which involves Software Architecture best practices and multiple Design case studies. ðŸ’¡ 

â˜€ Advanced Algorithms - Harvard: A 25 episode series on advanced Algorithms taught by the legend Jelani Nelson. This one is really advanced! ðŸ’¯
