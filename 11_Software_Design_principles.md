11 Must-Know Software Design Principles:

1) 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧-𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐎𝐂𝐏): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

2) 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐒𝐑𝐏): A class should have only one reason to change. It should have only one responsibility.

3) 𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐤𝐨𝐯 𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐋𝐒𝐏): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4) 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐃𝐈𝐏): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

5) 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: Favor composition (using objects of other classes) over inheritance (extending a base class). It promotes flexibility and reduces tight coupling.

6) 𝐋𝐚𝐰 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫 (𝐋𝐨𝐃): A module should not know about the internal workings of the objects it interacts with. It promotes loose coupling.

7) 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐭 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 (𝐃𝐑𝐘): Avoid duplicating code. Reuse code through abstraction, inheritance, or composition.

8) 𝐒𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬 (𝐒𝐨𝐂): Divide the software into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern or aspect of functionality.

9) 𝐊𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐈𝐭 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞, 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐝 (𝐊𝐈𝐒𝐒): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Keep things as simple as possible but not simpler.

10) 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 (𝐈𝐒𝐏): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

11) 𝐘𝐀𝐆𝐍𝐈 (𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐀𝐫𝐞𝐧'𝐭 𝐆𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐚 𝐍𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐈𝐭): Avoid over-engineering things. Focus on what's essential.

    𝗡𝗼 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗹𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲-𝗼𝗳𝗳.

Architecting systems is a balancing act. You can’t optimize one dimension without impacting another. 

Some classic trade-offs engineers grapple with:

🔹 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝘃𝘀. 𝗔𝘃𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: As the CAP theorem tells us, ultra-high availability might mean accepting eventual consistency.

🔹 𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝘃𝘀. 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗼𝘂𝘀: Synchronous calls are straightforward but block the caller; asynchronous flows improve throughput at the cost of added complexity (e.g., idempotency, message ordering).

🔹 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘃𝘀. 𝗧𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Caching and eventual consistency boost speed but risk stale data. More real-time accuracy can mean slower responses.

🔹 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘃𝘀. 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: A monolith is simpler to build and maintain initially, but microservices offer flexibility (at the cost of complexity).

🔹 𝗣𝗿𝗲-𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝘀. 𝗢𝗻-𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱: Precomputing analytics or aggregates lowers runtime latency but increases storage and processing complexity. On-demand computation keeps data fresh but can spike response times.

🔹 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘃𝘀. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: 99.99% uptime requires extra servers, backups, and complexity, which costs money.

🔹 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘃𝘀. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Tighter security measures protect your system but can slow down development and reduce ease of use.

🔹 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘃𝘀. 𝗕𝘂𝘆: Building in-house allows full customization but uses more engineering resources; buying off-the-shelf speeds things up but limits flexibility.

Great architects weigh these trade-offs based on context. There’s no one-size-fits-all: it’s about choosing the right compromise for the problem.

System Design Interviews were difficult,

Until I know these 23 principles.

1. If you need to scale an individual component, stick with Vertical Scaling first. Then, consider horizontal scaling when needed.

2. To deal with traffic spikes, evaluate the use of Autoscaling for Dynamic Resource Allocation.

3. If the system requires High Availability with Performance, consider using a Load Balancer.

4. If you're building a read-heavy system, it's a good idea to use a Cache.

5. Listen to the system requirements properly and note them down if needed.

6. To reduce the latency of static assets, consider using a CDN.

7. If you want to improve the database query performance, focus on the right indexes.

8. To scale the read requests to your database, consider Database Replication.

9. To scale write requests, consider Database Sharding.

10. Clarify your assumptions before jumping into the solution.

11. For global distribution of data, use a CDN.

12. If you want to store complex data such as videos, images, and files, go for an Object Storage.

13. To manage the load on the server and prevent denial-of-service attacks, use Rate Limiting.

14. To remove a Single Point of Failure, implement Redundancy and Isolation.

15. Clarify the Non-Functional Requirements as well and take them into account.

16. To improve the Fault Tolerance and Durability of your data, consider Data Replication techniques.

17. If the system needs to execute long-running tasks, use Async Processing and Background Processes.

18. To build a loosely coupled system, consider the use of Event-Driven Architecture.

19. If the system needs to store unstructured data, consider NoSQL databases.

20. Keep getting feedback during the discussion rather than waiting till the end.

21. To deal with large amounts of data flowing through the network, use Compression and Pagination techniques.

22. For automated builds and deployments, consider implementing CI/CD pipelines.

23. To achieve independent deployments of various parts of the system, consider microservices architecture.
