*******************

Clean Code Starts with a Clean Structure!
Especially in the world of Microservices!

If you're building microservices with Spring Boot, you’ve probably faced this question:
“How should I structure my project for long-term success?”

After working on multiple backend services, I’ve realized one thing —
A well-organized project = fewer bugs, faster devs, and happier teams!

Here’s a structure I swear by (and why it works):


📁 config/ – All your app-level setup lives here:
Security, CORS, Swagger, etc. One place, fully managed.

🌐 controller/ – REST APIs live here.
They’re the gatekeepers, receiving requests and handing them off to the service layer.

📦 dto/ – Request & response payloads.
Clean API contracts = flexible & maintainable code.

🧱 entity/ – JPA data models.
Mapped directly to your DB tables.

🗃️ repository/ – Data access layer.
Spring Data JPA does the heavy lifting.

⚙️ service/ – The brain of your app.
All your core business logic lives here!

🔧 service/impl/ – Concrete implementations.
Keeps interfaces neat and unit testing easier.

⏱️ workers/ – Scheduled jobs, Kafka consumers, async processors.
All behind-the-scenes magic.

❗ exception/ – Custom exceptions & global handlers.
Consistent error responses make debugging a breeze.

🔐 security/ – JWT filters, auth managers, security beans.
Locks the doors and guards your service.

🧰 util/ – Reusable helpers + your main class.
Keep the clutter out of business logic.



Why does this matter?
✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Faster onboarding for new devs
✅ Easier testing & debugging
✅ A scalable, maintainable foundation
