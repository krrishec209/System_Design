🚨 System Design Mastery: 10 Concepts That Saved My Career 
(And Will Save Yours)

When my startup failed after 4 years, I realized my system design decisions were 70% of the problem.

Since joining Google, I've learned the expensive lessons so you don't have to.

Here are the 10 principles I wish I'd mastered earlier:

🔹 1. Scalability & Availability → My biggest startup mistake? 

Building for 1M users when we had 5K. 

At Google, I've seen systems handle billions of requests by focusing first on what matters now. 

Master CAP Theorem and accept that 99.9% uptime means different things to different businesses.


🔹 2. Architecture Patterns → Microservices nearly bankrupted us. 

Each pattern has hidden costs—monoliths are easier to debug, microservices easier to scale, event-driven better for unpredictable workloads. 

Choose based on your team size and actual needs, not hype.


🔹 3. Scaling Techniques → We sharded too early and bled engineering hours. 

Start with the simplest solution (vertical scaling), then add complexity (load balancing, horizontal scaling) when metrics—not guesses—show you need it.


🔹 4. Databases → I once spent 3 weeks fixing a production issue because I chose MongoDB for the wrong reasons. 

The real question isn't SQL vs. NoSQL—it's understanding your access patterns and consistency needs before deciding.


🔹 5. Caching → A single Redis implementation cut our API latency by 65%. But our cache invalidation strategy was so complex we couldn't debug it under pressure. 

Simple caching beats clever caching every time.


🔹 6. Messaging → At my startup, direct API calls created a fragile system where one failing service brought everything down. 

Kafka and message queues aren't just tools—they're insurance policies against cascading failures.


🔹 7. API Design → We changed our API three times in two years. Good APIs evolve quietly. Great APIs don't need to change at all. 

RESTful or GraphQL matters less than consistent patterns and thoughtful versioning.


🔹 8. Monitoring & Logging → "The system's down" were words we dreaded because our monitoring was reactive, not proactive. 

Now I sleep better knowing Prometheus alerts will wake me before customers notice problems.


🔹 9. Security → Security isn't a feature; it's a mindset. 

At Google, I've learned to assume every input is malicious and every system will eventually be compromised. 

Plan for recovery, not just prevention.


🔹 10. Trade-offs → The hardest engineering lesson: there are no perfect systems, only appropriate ones. 

Your job isn't to build flawlessly—it's to make the right sacrifices for your specific context.

Every system design mistake taught me something valuable. Which one are you most worried about making?

📌 Save this for your next design review or interview prep.

Without Leetcode, you won’t pass the screening rounds.
Without system design, you’ll fail onsite interviews.

Solving good Leetcode problems will only help you clear 50% of the rounds. You still have to master system design basics.
