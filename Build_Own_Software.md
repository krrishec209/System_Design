The best way to learn to build software, is to build real software.

But often it’s hard to know what to build, so we end up spending time looking for ideas instead of building and learning.

To help with that, I’ve been sharing a list of project ideas complete with steps to work through in my Coding Challenges newsletter.

Here are some of the past challenges:
